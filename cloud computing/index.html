                <p class="text-small">Cloud computing is a general term for anything that involves delivering hosted
                    services over the internet. These services are divided into three main categories or types of cloud
                    computing: infrastructure as a service (IaaS), platform as a service (PaaS) and software as a
                    service (SaaS).</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Cloud computing[1] is the on-demand availability of computer system resources, especially 
            data storage (cloud storage) and computing power, without direct active management by the user.[2]
             Large clouds often have functions distributed over multiple locations, each location being a data center. Cloud computing relies on sharing of resources to achieve coherence and typically using a "pay-as-you-go" model which can help in reducing capital expenses but may also lead to
              unexpected operating expenses for unaware users.[3]</p>

        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The 1960s, the initial concepts of time-sharing became popularized via RJE (Remote Job
            Entry);[14] this terminology was mostly associated with large vendors such as IBM and DEC. Full-time-sharing
            solutions were available by the early 1970s on such platforms as Multics (on GE hardware), Cambridge CTSS,
            and the earliest UNIX ports (on DEC hardware). Yet, the "data centre" model where users submitted jobs to
            operators to run on IBM's mainframes was overwhelmingly predominant.

            In the 1990s, telecommunications companies, who previously offered primarily dedicated point-to-point data
            circuits, began offering virtual private network (VPN) services with comparable quality of service, but at a
            lower cost.</p>

            Cloud engineering is the application of engineering disciplines of cloud computing. It brings a systematic approach to the high-level concerns of commercialization, standardization and governance in conceiving, developing, operating and maintaining cloud computing systems. It is a multidisciplinary method encompassing contributions from diverse areas such as systems, software, web, performance, information technology engineering, security, platform, risk, and quality engineering.</p>
